# OpenPhantom
OpenPhantom is an open-source hardware project of a replacement main board for the Gradiente Phantom System model PH-8. The most famous NES clone made in Brazil during the 1980s and early 1990s.
The board was made as a hobby project based on a real board, internet schematics and a lot of reverse engineering.

Some modifications were made to make it easier to reproduce in Brazil and make it a little bit cheaper.
You can check the development progress on my twitter: @vagnerlc.
You are also invited to show any enhancements, modifications and make questions if needed.

You are free to use it in anyway you want: reproduce, sell, mod, etc.

I'm just a hobbyst trying to repair my old consoles and keep the very interesting history of this console alive.

The software used for the schematics was the Kicad 6.0.

Enjoy!
